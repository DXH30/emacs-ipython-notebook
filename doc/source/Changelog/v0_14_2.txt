v0.14.2
-------

Some improvements to company-mode support and very preliminary support for
eldoc, but to be honest things are still not too stable here for autocompletion.

Also, last release likely with any hope of support early versions of IPython
(2.x or 3.x), but why would you be using old and crufty versions of IPython?
Life is much better at later releases, come join us!
