v0.15.0
-------

The usual slew of fixes: see PR's 294, 296, 299, 301, 302, 303, 308, 309, 312,
314, 318, 319, among others.

Testing is back, thanks to dickmao! Travis-ci is also working again, so
downloadig the development version from MELPA should be much less riskier than
before.

Also some quality of life improvements for the completion backend. The code
should be more robust, sort of supports jedi, and works when in a connected
buffer. And, if you set `ein:use-company-annotations' to `t' you will get
annotation in the matches list, though there may be an initial performance hit as
ein builds a cache of of function definitions.

Add basic support for eldoc.

Note that ein no longer supports versions of ipython earlier than 3.0. Since
most everyone is probably using Jupyter and ipython 5.x or later at this point I
hope this won't be an issue.

Given this break in backward compatibility and the large improvements in
stability from dickmao's many recent contributions.
