v0.15.0
-------

The usual slew of fixes: see PR's 294, 296, 299, 301, 302, 303, 308, 309, 312,
314, 318, 319, among others.

Also some quality of life improvements for the completion backend. The code
should be more robust, sort of supports jedi, and works when in a connected
buffer. And, if you set `ein:use-company-annotations' to `t' you will get
annotation in the matches list, though there may be an initial performance hit as
ein builds a cache of of function definitions.

Add basic support for eldoc.
